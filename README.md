# Fluid-Simulation

This project does a rough fluid/diffusion simulation by updating a cell with the average of all its neighboors.

I plan on revisiting this project to implement more complex behavior when it comes down to the average of the neighboors:
  adding different weights to each neighboor in order to simulate directional flow
  adding a constant that is added after the averaging to simulate inflow or outflow
